Application
-----------

Because I'm offering this workshop at no cost, and with limited seat availability, I'm skewing preference to student from groups that are under-represented in information technology. To apply, complete this form:

Which of the following applies to you being a member of an under-represented group?
- my race, gender, sexual preference, gender identity, disability, religious affiliation, or age
- my socio-economic status, e.g., first member of family to seek higher education, or extended period of underemployment.
- my military service
- none of the above, I'd just like to attend
- prefer not to say, but, believe me, I qualify

Why are you interested in attending? What do you hope to gain from this workshop?

What is your experience or education in programming, web development, operations or related technology?

Do you have a working web application or mobile application? If so, please provide a link to it, or a brief description

Attest to attending or canceling w/ 24 hour notice, and to meeting workshop technology requirements**
